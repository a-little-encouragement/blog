                <h3><a href="#">Our Mess</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on January 7th, 2017.</h6>
				<p>
 It is one thing to believe that God will get us through situations we know He or someone else put us in. But what about the situations we put ourselves in? Many people are agreeing with the enemy, the accuser of the brethren, that they deserve what ever situation they are in and God will turn a deaf ear. The first part of that statement may be true but it leaves out the truth of the cross. Obviously, we don't escape every consequences of our actions, no more than we escape the consequences of others. But, thanks to Jesus, separation from God is never a consequence we have to face. We can always turn to Him and take comfort that He is the genius who works ALL things for good. Look at Joseph's brothers or David and Bathsheba. You have not and will not screw up past the point of purpose. You will never be so broken that God doesn't want you or can't use you. He is always the best place to run in times of trouble, even the trouble caused by our mistakes.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
				27 And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. 28 And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. 29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. - Romans 8:27-29
<br><br>
As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today. - Genesis 50:20
<br><br>
Psalm 51
<br>
Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God
To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet went to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.
<br><br>
51 Have mercy on me, O God,<br>
    according to your steadfast love;<br>
according to your abundant mercy<br>
    blot out my transgressions.<br>
2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,<br>
    and cleanse me from my sin!<br>
3 For I know my transgressions,<br>
    and my sin is ever before me.<br>
4 Against you, you only, have I sinned<br>
    and done what is evil in your sight,<br>
so that you may be justified in your words<br>
    and blameless in your judgment.<br>
5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,<br>
    and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br>
6 Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being,<br>
    and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.<br>
7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;<br>
    wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>
8 Let me hear joy and gladness;<br>
    let the bones that you have broken rejoice.<br>
9 Hide your face from my sins,<br>
    and blot out all my iniquities.<br>
10 Create in me a clean heart, O God,<br>
    and renew a right spirit within me.<br>
11 Cast me not away from your presence,<br>
    and take not your Holy Spirit from me.<br>
12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation,<br>
    and uphold me with a willing spirit.<br>
13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways,<br>
    and sinners will return to you.<br>
14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,<br>
    O God of my salvation,<br>
    and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.<br>
15 O Lord, open my lips,<br>
    and my mouth will declare your praise.<br>
16 For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;<br>
    you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.<br>
17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;<br>
    a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.<br>
18 Do good to Zion in your good pleasure;<br>
    build up the walls of Jerusalem;<br>
19 then will you delight in right sacrifices,<br>
    in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;<br>
    then bulls will be offered on your altar.

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
