                <h3><a href="#">Is God Forgetful?</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on September 24th, 2017.</h6>
				<p>       	
I know God is forgiving but forgetful?
<br>
Someone recently had a vision for me that had me questioning this. The vision was of me in a royal dress with a large crown. "What makes her so special?" she asked God. He replied, "She would do literally anything I asked her to." 
<br>
But I had with a problem with that. I felt it wasn't true. I could think of failures of obedience from that day alone. 
<br>
"I don't remember that", God said with a dismissive shrug when I brought up my failure later.*
<br>
Did I hear that right? Was that even Biblical? God knows everything, how could He forget anything?
<br>
As I pondered that I found some interesting New Testament scriptures about Old Testament characters. 
<br><br>
(about Abraham and Sarah)
<br>
19 Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead. 20 Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, 21 being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. Romans 4:19-21(NIV)
<br><br>
11 By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.(Hebrews 11:11)(ESV)
<br><br>
Wait a minute, "not weakening" or "wavering"? We are talking about the same Sarah that laughed and the same Abraham that fathered Ishmael right?
<br><br>
While I thought it was sweet that God was willing to over look sin and write our stories in such flattering words, it still just felt like a lie.
<br>
God showed me an image in my mind of a brown cloth. "What color is this cloth?" He asked. I answered, "brown". He shook his head no. Then He took the cloth and dipped it in water. When He took it out the cloth was pure white. 
<br>
"Neither you nor the devil has better vision then me. I can just see past the dirt"
<br>
"I know who you are better than you do", God reminded me, "I made you. I know you love me more than you know you love me"
<br><br>
Turns out, it isn't true humility to argue with God. He knows my heart's desire is to do the will of the Father, even if I don't always do it perfectly. He sees all the things that I have gotten right. He sees every sacrifice and act of devotion that I have done and His heart swells with love and pride.
<br>
God wants more of his children to define themselves through his eyes. He wants us to speak truth rather than agreeing to lies. 
<br>
He told me take that image of me that I was given and keep it in my heart. To (mentally/metaphorically) take it out and look at it often. 
<br>
I pray that anyone reading this would be given a similar image of who they really are. 
<br><br>
*Okay it is true God doesn't have physical shoulders to shrug or a head to shake or palm with which to face-palm but He can communicate expression with impressions through the Holy Spirit same as He can give words and pictures without light or sound waves. Spiritual shrug.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me - Psalm 51:10(NIV)
<br><br>
"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations." - Jeremiah 1:5(NIV)
<br><br>
"Come now, let us settle the matter," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. - Isaiah 1:18(NIV)

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
