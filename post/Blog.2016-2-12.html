Modern media outlets are the nuclear weapons of spiritual warfare.<br> 
Blasting<br>
Radiating<br> 
Be mindful of your diet.<br>

It is not a well kept secret that I'm a huge advocate for media fasts. I use to think I was exempt from the law of GBGO (garbage in, garbage out). Being honest, I'm about as exempt from it as the law of gravity. Like many things, I was blind to it while standing in it. There is also the principle of noise. It is harder to hear and focus on God when various other things are playing. There is a third principle that made a media fast powerful. When you are truly seeking to know God, and you take action to try to make that happen, He is faithful. He always honors it. Our God doesn't play hide and seek. He runs to us the moment we get to the property line.

<br><br>
that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; - Acts 17:27
<br><br>
Seek the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually. - 1 Chronicles 16:11	
<br><br>
The LORD has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men To see if there are any who understand, Who seek after God. - Psalm 14:2
<br><br>
And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. - Hebrews 11:6
<br><br>
Sow with a view to righteousness, Reap in accordance with kindness; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the LORD Until He comes to rain righteousness on you. - Hosea 10:12
<br><br>
"As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart and a willing mind; for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands every intent of the thoughts If you seek Him, He will let you find Him; but if you forsake Him, He will reject you forever.- 1 Chronicles 28:9
<br><br>
When You said, "Seek My face," my heart said to You, "Your face, O LORD, I shall seek." - Psalm 27:8

O God, You are my God; I shall seek You earnestly; My soul thirsts for You, my flesh yearns for You, In a dry and weary land where there is no water. - Psalm 63:1
<br><br>
"But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. - Matthew 6:33
<br><br>
“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it. - Matthew 13:44-46
<br><br>
and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land. - 2 Chronicles 7:14
<br><br>
Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; Let those who love Your salvation say continually, "The LORD be magnified!" - Psalm 40:16

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
