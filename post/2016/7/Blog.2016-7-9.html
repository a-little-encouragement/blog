                <h3><a href="#">On Faith: The Grown Gift</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on July 9th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
Early on in my Christian life I took a spiritual gift test. My highest scoring gift was faith. True to form I didn't believe it. I didn't even understand how faith was a gift. Wasn't it just something you just did or felt? If God wanted to give me a gift why didn't he just give it to me? What was it even for? If I'm the "mighty woman of faith" God called me why did I have doubts? 
<br><br>
Here is what I've learned. 
<br><br>
Faith is a gift and it is grown. 
<br><br>
God made me some big promises. I knew I was suppose to be a person of great faith but I was doubting. That is when God taught me about the grown aspect of faith. Faith isn't just a warm fuzzy feeling that means I have no cares. It isn't denial or apathy. It is trust. It is expectation built on a foundation of experience. I have seen God do miracles things. Therefor, if God doesn't change, I can expect that to hold true. Faith is purified in fire. Each year I find my faith stronger than the next. 
<br><br>
This is where the gift part comes in. Faith is a gift, given through trials. It is not something I can create on my own. It is a sanctified memory and perspective that can come only through the Holy Spirit. Without the lens of the Holy Spirit through a yielded imagination those trials just appear as random tragedy and the future as a bleak uncertain place. 
<br><br>
Now do not think that faith is something only for a special few. The gifts of the spirit Paul mentioned and people talk about today are those gifts given through not to. God wasn't saying He was going to make me someone who never had doubts. He was saying he is going to spring up a well of faith for others. He has/is/will put/ting me through trials to be a witness. I'm here to help re-frame others views to a more heaven minded one. I'm a witness to the fact that the devil is a liar and Jesus is alive. God didn't leave us with no evidence or witness. There are many. So now that we are surrounded by such a cloud of witnesses, let us run with endurance and confidence. 
				</p>
				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
1Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off every encumbrance and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with endurance the race set out for us. 2Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at right hand of the throne of God - Hebrews 12:1-2
<br><br>
For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God -  Ephesians 2:8
<br><br>
2 My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, 3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. 4 But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. - James 1:2-4
<br><br>
And Abram believed the LORD, and the LORD counted him as righteous because of his faith. - Genesis 15:6

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
