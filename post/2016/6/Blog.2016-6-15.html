				<p>
During a listening prayer someone describe a beautiful place and said that was where me and God meet, just the two of us.  Then came the knife. The person said they felt God say He wished I'd come there more often. 
<br>
My time is valuable. Rest is not easy for me and I still struggle to ever truly rest. It has left me a lot of days feeling like an exhausted race horse. I did a lot of running but never felt like I got any where. It was never enough. So for God to want more of my time just seemed like adding more to the list. I remember coming to God with a rushed attitude. He had five minutes to tell me what he had to say and here was my list of request.
<br>
Time with God; check.
<br>
One of the first things I remember God telling me was part of Psalm 46:10; "Be still, and know that I am God". He never really stopped saying it. "Still" is a constant refrain. I confess because of it I have developed a love/hate relationship with that verse. I don't want to be still. The NASB reads "Cease striving". God's point wasn't to do more, it was rest more.  More specifically, rest in his presence and know Him.
<br>
God just wanted to spend time with me. The same is true for you. When people are in love with someone they just want to spend time with that person. They don't care very much what they do or what they talk about they just want their love's attention. Jesus is crazy, recklessly, irrevocably, and purely in love with you. Of all the wealth in Heaven and Earth, of everything He has made, nothing moves his heart like you do. He isn't a commander giving orders, He is the dearest friend asking for a bit of time. He is also creator of all Heaven and Earth, my savior and redeemer who bought me out of slavery. If there is anything worthy of my time it is surely Jesus. No matter what is happening around us we can always go to that secret place in our hearts, the Temple of the Most High God.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked. -  Psalm 84:10 
<br><br>
“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.” - John 16:33
<br><br>
Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when people succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes. - Psalm 37:7
<br><br>
28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” - Matthew 11:28-30
<br>
25Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26Look at the birds of the air: They do not sow or reap or gather into barns—and yet your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his lifespan?c
<br>
28And why do you worry about clothes? Consider how the lilies of the field grow: They do not labor or spin. 29Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these. 30If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
<br>
31Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32For the pagans pursue all these things, and your Heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you.
<br>
34Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own. - Luke 12:22-34
<br><br>
Psalm 23
<br><br>
A psalm of David.
<br><br>
1 The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing. 2 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, 3 he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake. 4 Even though I walk through the darkest valley,I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
