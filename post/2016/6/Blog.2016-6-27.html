Last post I talked about going to the secret place where you and God meet alone. In the Chronicles of Narnia there is a good illustration of this. 
<br>
Lucy Pevensie saw Aslan earlier but the others did not, so they did not follow him. The path turned out to be a bad one and the gang is forced to backtrack. That night Lucy hears Alsan calling so she goes to meet him by herself in the woods. Of course, as soon as she sees Aslan she runs and embraces him.
<blockquote>
For a time she was so happy that she did not want to speak. But Aslan spoke.
<br>
“Lucy,” he said, “we must not lie here for long. You have work in hand, and much time has been lost today.”
<br>
“Yes, wasn’t it a shame?” said Lucy. “I saw you all right. They wouldn’t believe me. They’re all so -”
<br>
From somewhere deep inside Aslan’s body there came the faintest suggestion of a growl. 
<br>
“I’m sorry,” said Lucy, who understood some of his moods. “I didn’t mean to start slanging the others. But it wasn’t my fault anyway, was it?” 
<br>
The Lion looked straight into her eyes. 
<br>
“Oh, Aslan,” said Lucy. “You don’t mean it was? How could I - l couldn’t have left the others and come up to you alone, how could I? Don’t look at me like that... oh well, I suppose I could. Yes, and it wouldn’t have been alone, I know, not if I was with you. But what would have been the good?”
<br>
Aslan said nothing.
<br>
“You mean,” said Lucy rather faintly, “that it would have turned out all right -somehow? But how? Please, Aslan! Am I not to know?”
<br>
“To know what would have happened, child?” said Aslan. “No. Nobody is ever told that.”
<br>
“Oh dear,” said Lucy.
<br>
“But anyone can find out what will happen,” said Aslan. “If you go back to the others now, and wake them up; and tell them you have seen me
again; and that you must all get up at once and follow me - what will happen? There is only one way of finding out.
<br>
“Do you mean that is what you want me to do?” gasped Lucy.
<br>
“Yes, little one,” said Aslan.
<br>
“Will the others see you too?” asked Lucy. 
<br>
“Certainly not at first,” said Aslan. “Later on, it depends.”
<br>
“But they won’t believe me!” said Lucy.
<br>
“It doesn’t matter,” said Aslan.
<br>
“Oh dear, oh dear,” said Lucy. “And I was so pleased at finding you again. And I thought you’d let me stay. And I thought you’d come roaring in and frighten all the enemies away -like last time. And now everything is going to be horrid.”
<br>
“It is hard for you, little one,” said Aslan. “But things never happen the same way twice. It has been hard for us all in Narnia before now.”
<br>
Lucy buried her head in his mane to hide from his face. But there must have been magic in his mane. She could feel lion-strength going into her. Quite suddenly she sat up. “I’m sorry, Aslan,” she said. “I’m ready now.”
<br>
“Now you are a lioness,” said Aslan. “And now all Narnia will be renewed. But come. We have no time to lose.”
</blockquote>― C.S. Lewis, Prince Caspian
<br><br>
There are many good points I could make from this. The one I want to make today is about the nature of prayer. Prayer is not a drive-by wish list. It is a two way communication. As such, it can provide clarity and turn our head and heart around to what it should be. This is why bringing every thought to Jesus is so important. When I tell Him things, He often doesn't even need to say anything. The Holy Spirit allows me to read His "face". Focused on Him, I just know certain plans are foolish, certain thoughts selfish and prideful, or a particular action needs taking. The light of Truth illuminates much. The strength needed for those actions is also provided.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
Search me, O God, and know my heart!
<br>
    Try me and know my thoughts!
<br>
  And see if there be any grievous way in me,
<br>
    and lead me in the way everlasting! - Psalm 139:23-24
<br><br>
Create in me a clean heart, O God,
<br>
And renew a steadfast spirit within me. - Psalm 51:10
<br><br>
 I made my sins known to you, and I did not cover up my guilt.
<br>
I decided to confess them to you, O Lord.
<br>
    Then you forgave all my sins. - Psalm 32:5
<br><br>
The Lord says,
<br>
    “I will instruct you.
<br>
    I will teach you the way that you should go.
<br>
    I will advise you as my eyes watch over you.
<br>
  Don’t be stubborn like a horse or mule.
<br>
    They need a bit and bridle in their mouth to restrain them,
<br>
        or they will not come near you.” - Psalm 32:8-9

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
