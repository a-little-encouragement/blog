                <h3><a href="#">Common Confusion: Rest vs Play</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on March 31st, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
Any one who has gone to Disney World will tell you there is a difference between rest and play. We recognize this with kids. Why do we think they are the same thing when we become adults? We need both. Don't let others make you feel guilty for needing to play and don't let others make you feel guilty for rest. Don't make others feel guilty. In our society we constantly whip each other so much many of us don't even do one of them. For what? Often over things that do not even matter in the big picture. Why? Why are we so determined not to enjoy this race and make others do the same? Why are so many of us bowed down to worship the "to do" list? 
<br><br>
We can learn many things from dogs. Dogs were made for purpose. They know how to work to with a beautiful attitude, just pleasing their master. They know how to play and find delight in simple things. They know how to collapse at their masters feet and take a nap. Work hard, play hard, nap hard.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. - John 10:10b
<br><br>
Then young women will dance and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow. - Jeremiah 31:13 
<br><br>
Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break forth into joyous song and sing praises! - Psalm 98:4
<br><br>
He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
<br>
He leads me beside the still waters.
<br>
He restores my soul; - Psalm 23:2-3a
<br><br>
8 “Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. - Exodus 20:8-10
<br><br>
 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” - Matthew 11:28-30
<br><br>
Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house. 39 And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His word. 40 But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she approached Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.”
<br><br>
41 And Jesus answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things. 42 But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.” - Luke 10:38-42

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
