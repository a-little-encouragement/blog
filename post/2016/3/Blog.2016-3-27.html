Where could I even begin to talk about the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It changed everything forever.
<br>
<blockquote>
"Death In His Grave" by John Mark McMillan
<br><br>
Though the earth cried<br>
Out for blood<br>
Satisfied her hunger was<br>
Billows calmed on raging seas<br>
For the souls of men she craved<br>
Sun and moon from balcony<br>
Turned their head in disbelief<br>
Their precious love would taste<br>
The sting<br>
Disfigured and disdained<br>
<br>
So three days in darkness slept<br>
The morning sun<br>
Of righteousness<br>
But rose to shame<br>
The throws of death<br>
And overturn his rule<br>
Now daughters<br>
And the sons of men<br>
Would pay not their dues again<br>
The debt of blood<br>
They owed was rent<br>
When the day rolled anew<br>
<br>
On Friday a thief<br>
On Sunday a king<br>
Laid down in grief<br>
But woke with the keys<br>
Of hell on that day<br>
The first born of the slain<br>
The man Jesus Christ laid<br>
Death in his grave<br>
<br>
He has cheated hell<br>
And seated us above the fall<br>
In desperate places he paid our<br>
Wages one time once and for all<br>
</blockquote>

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2 looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.<br>
3 For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls. - Hebrews 12:1-3<br>
<br>
Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. 2 Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.”
<br>
3 Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and were going to the tomb. 4 So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first. 5 And he, stooping down and looking in, saw the linen cloths lying there; yet he did not go in. 6 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen cloths lying there, 7 and the handkerchief that had been around His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded together in a place by itself. 8 Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb first, went in also; and he saw and believed. 9 For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. 10 Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.
<br>
11 But Mary stood outside by the tomb weeping, and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the tomb. 12 And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 13 Then they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?”
<br>
She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.”
<br>
14 Now when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?”
<br>
She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, “Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.”
<br>
16 Jesus said to her, “Mary!”
<br>
She turned and said to Him, “Rabboni!” (which is to say, Teacher). - John 20:1-16

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
