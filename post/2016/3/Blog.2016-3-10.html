                <h3><a href="#">Lead Me To The Cross</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on March 10th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
"God I know this person will eventually come around but the waiting sucks! Why can't they just get it now! Why can't they appreciate me now?!"<br>
On and on I went complaining to Jesus about this when he stopped me with one sentence.<br>
"Yeah that hurts doesn't"<br>
You might not understand what all God was saying but I did. You see, my complaints became angry as if God didn't know what I was going through and didn't understand. With his words came remembrance of our walk, of how long I ran from him. I remembered my God knows my pain times a billion and he is not apathetic to it. Edith Schaeffer wrote no one will ever be as alone as Christ was on the cross. No one will ever feel as rejected and heart broken as Jesus did, does, and continues to. He had to wait for me. 
<br>
A little time passed and this started rolling around my brain as I was preparing for the women's retreat. God spoke again, "Hey Dallas, you were worth the wait." 
<br>
Wow. 
<br>
At the women's retreat, there was a cross in one corner of the room. As I stared at it God's words from that night ran through my mind. How could I be worth that? The truth is, I'm not. Nothing about me is so great that I'm worth the price paid. But Jesus takes so much delight in me, in us, he loves each of us so much, he looks at the price and says, "worth it".		
<br><br>
After I finished this post I came across the first video/song listed. God is thematic and ironic that way. Steffany says it well, sit for a moment and just let that settle in. It is still settling for me.

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
