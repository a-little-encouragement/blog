                <h3><a href="#">Dreams</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on March 10th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
Religion tends to kill dreams. Have you noticed that? It snuffs out the flame of passion. I don't believe that is what Jesus wants. We are evidence that our God is a God of passion. Bill Johnson made an interesting observation about the conversation between Jesus and his disciples as they quarreled about who was greatest. God didn't tell them not to want greatness, he redefined it. I'm not preaching prosperity theology but we need to consider wanting certain things is okay. Some dreams might even be God given. Wanting nothing above God isn't the same as not wanting anything. We shouldn't let fear of our self and failure kill our dreams. 
<br>
I recommend the book Restless by Jennie Allen (although you should probably start with her first book Anything). Jesus died to set you free so be free to dream.

                <h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
46 An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest. 47 But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side 48 and said to them, “Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.” - Luke 9:46-48
<br><br>
It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. - Galatians 5:1

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
