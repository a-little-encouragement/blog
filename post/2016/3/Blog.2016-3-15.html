                <h3><a href="#">Life Verse</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on March 15th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
I've heard before about life verses but I never picked one. It got brought up again recently. I started to think about what mine would be if I had to pick. There are many verses I like and several that have spoken to me strongly and I've held through a season, or still hold, after it spoke to me in a way only scripture can. 


<br><br>
Jeremiah 29:11-13 
<br>
11 For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. 12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. 13 You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. 

<br><br>

Jeremiah 31:3-4
<br>
3  &nbsp &nbsp   the Lord appeared to him from far away.
<br>
I have loved you with an everlasting love;
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you.
<br>
4 Again I will build you, and you shall be built,
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp O virgin Israel!
<br>
Again you shall adorn yourself with tambourines
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp and shall go forth in the dance of the merrymakers.


<br><br>
Philippians 1:6 
And I am certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns
<br><br>
There are several others. 
<br><br>
As I thought about this God reminded me there is a scripture always on my hand. More specifically, it is on a ring that is almost always on my hand. 
<br><br>
I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine - Song of Songs 6:3a
<br><br>
I remembered why, out of all the verses, that is the one on the ring. Everything boils down to it. Jesus has good plans for me because I am His and He is mine. He continues his loving faithfulness because I am His and He is mine. Jesus will continue to work in me because I am His and He is mine. Jesus died for me on that cross then walked out of the grave because I am His and He is mine. It is the corner stone of my identity and my faith. I belong to Jesus.

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
