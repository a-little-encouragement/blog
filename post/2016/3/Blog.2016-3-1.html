I was at a women's retreat this weekend and ended up hiking Saturday to a mountain summit. While there, a friend of mine knew she needed to see the sunrise from that summit. So at six in the morning we walked back up there. At one steep point, towards the end, my friend knew that if I stopped then I wouldn't make it. She pointed out a tree just at the top of this treacherous part and said, "just get to that tree. Get to that tree then you can rest". I moved faster than I had the whole trip. I ran to that tree and wrapped my arms around it. I held on to that tree as I rested. Shortly after, while watching the sunrise from the summit, God brought that tree to mind and said, "Dallas, I am the tree." Just as that tree became a focal point that allowed me to moved faster so is Jesus to our lives. He is my focal point; my goal.

				<p>
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. - Matthew 6:33
<br>
<br>
Psalm 97 
<br>
The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice;
<br>
    let the many coastlands be glad!
<br>
2 Clouds and thick darkness are all around him;
<br>
    righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
<br>
3 Fire goes before him
<br>
    and burns up his adversaries all around.
<br>
4 His lightnings light up the world;
<br>
    the earth sees and trembles.
<br>
5 The mountains melt like wax before the Lord,
<br>
    before the Lord of all the earth.
<br>
6 The heavens proclaim his righteousness,
<br>
    and all the peoples see his glory.
<br>
7 All worshipers of images are put to shame,
<br>
    who make their boast in worthless idols;
<br>
    worship him, all you gods!
<br>
8 Zion hears and is glad,
<br>
    and the daughters of Judah rejoice,
<br>
    because of your judgments, O Lord.
<br>
9 For you, O Lord, are most high over all the earth;
<br>
    you are exalted far above all gods.
<br>
10 O you who love the Lord, hate evil!
<br>
    He preserves the lives of his saints;
<br>
    he delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
<br>
11 Light is sown[a] for the righteous,
<br>
    and joy for the upright in heart.
<br>
12 Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous,
<br>
    and give thanks to his holy name!

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
