				<p>
What can I say on this day. There are no words. Thank you Jesus. Thank you.
<br>
<blockquote>
"On My Cross" by FFH
<br><br>
How wide is Your love<br>
That You would stretch Your arms<br>
And go around the world<br>
And why for me would a Savior's cry be heard<br>
<br>
I don't know<br>
Why You went where I was meant to go<br>
I don't know<br>
Why You love me so<br>
<br>
How deep is Your grace<br>
That you could see my need<br>
And chose to take my place<br>
And then for me, these words I'd hear You say<br>
<br>
Father no<br>
Forgive them for they know not what they do<br>
I will go<br>
Because I love them so<br>
<br>
Those were my nails<br>
that was my crown<br>
that pierced your hands<br>
and your brow<br>
those were my thorns<br>
those were my scorns<br>
those were my tears that feel down<br>
and just as u said it would be<br>
u did it all for me<br>
and after u counted the cost<br>
you took my shame<br> 
my blame on my cross

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. - John 3:16
<br><br>
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, 4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, 5 having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved.
<br><br>
7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace 8 which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 9 having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself, 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both[a] which are in heaven and which are on earthâ€”in Him. 11 In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will, 12 that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory.
<br><br>
13 In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory. - Ephesians 1:3-14

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
