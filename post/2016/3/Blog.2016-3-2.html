                <h3><a href="#">Tales From The Mountains Pt. 2: Perseverance</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on March 2st, 2016.</h6>
<p>
While hiking to the summit I felt so weak. I felt so out of shape as I struggled up the mountain. "I'm not showing you a weakness" God said, "I'm showing you a strength. Your tenacity". I replayed the hike but with a different mind set. I had no misgivings about how hard that walk was going to be. I knew I was going to get dirty and was going to feel sick. I went anyway. I feel down and felt like I was going to throw up. But I never thought, "I'll stop and turn back". When it felt like my legs may not take another step I thought, "I'll crawl". I saw my Father's delight that I could be so determined; that I would persevere. That is what God wants from us; to not just run up the mountains we can easily skip and jump across, but to be so determined and steadfast, we follow Him up the hard ones. After all, he hiked the hardest hill for us. The journey up is worth it and the sunrise looks so much better from a summit.

                <h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
	Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, - Hebrews 12:1	
<br><br>
Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. - Philippians 3:12
<br><br>
3 Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, 4 and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, 5 and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. - Romans 5:3-5
<br><br>
2 Count it all joy, my brothers,[a] when you meet trials of various kinds, 3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. - James 1:2-4
<br><br>
Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. - Romans 12:12
<br><br>
11 being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, 12 and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light. - Colossians 1:11-12 
<br><br>
 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. - Galatians 6:9
<br><br>
Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him - James 1:12

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
