                <h3><a href="#">Ashira</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on March 9th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
I was lying on my floor, in pain from a migraine, praying for the pain to end when I felt God tell me,  "Sing anyway." So I did. I sang the first song that came to my mind. I got the image from Job of the devil mocking telling God I would fall away from the trial. Jesus knows me better. I began to sing. The words were poorly spoken Hebrew mostly from Exodus 15. 
<br><br>
Ashira l'adonai ki gaoh ga-ah
<br>
(I will sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously) 
<br>
Ashira l'adonai ki gaoh ga-ah
<br>
(I will sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously) 
<br>
Mi chamocha baelim adonai
<br>
(Who is like You, oh Lord, among the celestial) 
<br>
Mi kamocha nedar bakodesh
<br>
(Who is like You, majestic in holiness) 
<br>
Nachita v'chas-d'cha am zu ga-alta
<br>
(In Your love, You lead the people You redeemed) 
<br>
Nachita v'chas-d'cha am zu ga-alta
<br>
(In Your love, You lead the people You redeemed) 
<br>
Ashira ashira ashira
<br>
(I will sing, I will sing, I will sing)
<br><br>
My pain didn't go away but they provided clarity. They strengthen my faith. Our praise is a weapon. The enemy and his lies, the troubles of this world, hold no power in the light of God's glory. They shrink and fade.

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
