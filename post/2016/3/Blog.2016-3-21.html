                <h3><a href="#">Impatience & Fear Pt. 1: Answers</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on March 21st, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
This a a three part series of reflections and summaries of this talk by Kim Walker-Smith. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
We often want answers from God that He will just not give. We may even get a typically religious answer but it doesn't satisfy. These questions can become barriers. They have been for me and I've watched others struggle as well. Kim put into words what I've recognized subconsciously. The solution isn't getting the answers. It is deciding that you want Jesus more. There are questioned that never got answered but I wanted that intimacy more. It is worth letting go. 
<br>
<blockquote>
“And so seated next to my father in the train compartment, I suddenly asked, "Father, what is sexsin?"
He turned to look at me, as he always did when answering a question, but to my surprise he said nothing. At last he stood up, lifted his traveling case off the floor and set it on the floor.
Will you carry it off the train, Corrie?" he said.
I stood up and tugged at it. It was crammed with the watches and spare parts he had purchased that morning.
It's too heavy," I said.
Yes," he said, "and it would be a pretty poor father who would ask his little girl to carry such a load. It's the same way, Corrie, with knowledge. Some knowledge is too heavy for children. When you are older and stronger, you can bear it. For now you must trust me to carry it for you.”
<br><br>
“Some knowledge is too heavy...you cannot bear it...your Father will carry it until you are able.” 
― Corrie ten Boom, The Hiding Place

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
20 When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’”

21 At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. 22 So he replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor. 23 Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.” - Luke 7:21-23
<br><br>
“Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
    Tell me, if you have understanding.
5 Who determined its measurements—surely you know!
    Or who stretched the line upon it?
6 On what were its bases sunk,
    or who laid its cornerstone,
7 when the morning stars sang together
    and all the sons of God shouted for joy? - Job 38:4-7

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
