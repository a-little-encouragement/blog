                <h3><a href="#">Salt and Light</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on November 4th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
Things don't look very great in our country right now. We don't know what will happen but God does. He is still in charge and he doesn't fall off of his throne. He isn't shocked and freaking out. Remember when the Ark of the Covenant got captured. It was probably one of the scariest times for the nation especially that anyone alive at the time had been through. Unseen to the Israelites the Philistines were having to scrape their broken "god" of the floor. They didn't have to do anything. They woke up and the arc was back (with gifts). <br>
Right now especially we need to be the salt and light of the world. It doesn't take a stadium flood light to illuminate a corner and it doesn't take a pound of salt to season a steak. It only takes a little. It doesn't take a sophisticated argument, sermon, or grand gesture. A simple smile and kind word can be just what the world needs.				
				</p>
				<h6>Verses</h6>
				<p>
13 “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
<br>
14 “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. - Matthew 5:13-16				
<br><br>
2 Then they carried the ark into Dagon’s temple and set it beside Dagon. 3 When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! They took Dagon and put him back in his place. 4 But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained. - 1 Samuel 5:2-4
<br><br>
11 They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors. 12 Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.
<br>
13 Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight. - 1 Samuel 6:11-13
<br><br>
25 “To whom will you compare me?
<br>
    Who is my equal?” asks the Holy One.
<br>
26 Look up into the heavens.
<br>
    Who created all the stars?
<br>
He brings them out like an army, one after another,
<br>
    calling each by its name.
<br>
Because of his great power and incomparable strength,
<br>
    not a single one is missing.
<br>
27 O Jacob, how can you say the Lord does not see your troubles?
<br>
    O Israel, how can you say God ignores your rights?
<br>
28 Have you never heard?
<br>
    Have you never understood?
<br>
The Lord is the everlasting God,
<br>
    the Creator of all the earth.
<br>
He never grows weak or weary.
<br>
    No one can measure the depths of his understanding.
<br>
29 He gives power to the weak
<br>
    and strength to the powerless. - Isaiah 40:25-29
<br><br>
4 “Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?
<br>
Tell Me, if you have understanding.
<br>
5 Who determined its measurements?
<br>
Surely you know!
<br>
Or who stretched the line upon it?
<br>
6 To what were its foundations fastened?
<br>
Or who laid its cornerstone,
<br>
7 When the morning stars sang together,
<br>
And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
<br>
8 “Or who shut in the sea with doors,
<br>
When it burst forth and issued from the womb;
<br>
9 When I made the clouds its garment,
<br>
And thick darkness its swaddling band;
<br>
10 When I fixed My limit for it,
<br>
And set bars and doors;
<br>
11 When I said,
<br>
‘This far you may come, but no farther,
<br>
And here your proud waves must stop!’
<br>
12 “Have you commanded the morning since your days began,
<br>
And caused the dawn to know its place,
<br>
13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
<br>
And the wicked be shaken out of it? - Job 38:4-13

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
