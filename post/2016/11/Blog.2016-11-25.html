                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on November 25th, 2016.</h6>

 "What don't you see?" 
 <br>
That was the question God asked me as I looked at my arms like He had asked. The answer was scars. Where scars should be my skin is smooth. 
 <br>
"Sometimes" He said "My grace is what you don't see."
 <br> 
I didn't deserve to be healed so fully. I didn't deserve anything other than death. The marks that use to be on my arms were my own doing. 
God didn't have to but He did. And I hadn't even noticed. I stopped to think about all the gifts God has given that I don't even see. 
How many consequences for my own actions have I not endured? How many car wrecks have I not been in? How many illness have I not had? 
How many schemes and weapons have been formed against me that were broken before they touched me? I was reminded that God is not distant 
and inactive. He watches me like a parent watches an infant or toddler, with constant vigilance. That is certainly something to be thankful 
for.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— 6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, 9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast. - Ephesians 2:4-9
<br><br>
13 For you formed my inward parts;
<br>
    you knitted me together in my mother's womb.
<br>
14 I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
<br>
Wonderful are your works;
<br>
    my soul knows it very well.
<br>
15 My frame was not hidden from you,
<br>
when I was being made in secret,
<br>
    intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
<br>
16 Your eyes saw my unformed substance;
<br>
in your book were written, every one of them,
<br>
    the days that were formed for me,
<br>
    when as yet there was none of them. - Psalm 139:13-16
<br><br>
8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. - Romans 5:8
<br><br>
16 Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.- Hebrews 4:16
<br><br>
	4 	Enter his gates with thanksgiving,

and his courts with praise!

Give thanks to him; bless his name! - Psalm 100:4
<br><br>
Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,

for his steadfast love endures forever! - Psalm 107:1
<br><br>
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. - James 1:17
<br><br>
Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift! - 2 Corinthians 9:15
<br><br>
 Oh give thanks to the Lord; call upon his name;

make known his deeds among the peoples! - Psalm 105:1
<br><br>
that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent.
O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever! - Psalm 30:12

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
