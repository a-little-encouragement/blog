                <h3><a href="#">Working For Good</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on November 11th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
Romans 8:28 says all things work together for good. It does not say all things are good. We aren't commanded to pretend every thing that happens is good or even okay. This statement isn't rendered invalid because bad things happen. When I read that, the image comes to my mind of a master craftsman working whatever raw materials are handed him into something beautiful. We live in a broken world. There are many things that aren't good. Not only do we have our fallen natures but we also have an enemy that, although defeated, is kicking and screaming on his way down. But God is a master artist. You'll have broken pieces and ashes left from some seasons but God can use them. He has a plan of how to use them before you even get them. Joseph is a classic example of this. God didn't stop or erase all the injustice and pain done to him. But God did use it to save more than one nation. I feel in our nation right now many need this reminder. God never leaves us or takes a break. He is capable of using bad as well as good, injustices as well as justice, pain as well as joy, the corrupt as well as the pure. These things are what they are, but they have always and will always be in His hands.

				<h6>Verses</h6>
				<p>
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. - Romans 8:28
<br><br>
You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. - Genesis 50:20 
<br><br>
16 For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. 17 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. - Colossians 1:16-17
<br><br>
12 I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. 13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me. - Philippians 4:12-13

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
