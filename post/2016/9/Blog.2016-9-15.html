GIGO - Garbage in, garbage out. You can not make a delicious meal with spoiled ingredients.
<br><br>
Last post I mentioned watching your media diet. This is something I'm passionate about because it has made such a difference in my life. We need to accept we are all influenced by our surroundings and especially the media we partake in. No one is an exception. 
<br>
I'm not saying we can never watch/listen/read secular media. Like with your food diet it isn't that you can never have a cupcake. You just can't live off cupcakes and expect to feel well. Also just like with your food diet, taking in good is just as important as leaving out bad. If you focus on adding more things you should eat, things you shouldn't eat get pushed out. Of course you still need to be wary of the bad. There are things you need to watch less or not during certain times or stop completely. The tricky thing is this is personal to everyone. You have to let the Holy Spirit guide you.<br>
The last thing is I strongly encourage media fast. It can really make a huge impact on your life. Remember, God is always delighted by seeking him and he always honors it.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things. - Philippians 4:8	
<br><br>
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in Your sight, O LORD, my rock and my Redeemer.

- Psalm 19:14
<br><br>
29 Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, 30 who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. - Mark 10:29-30
<br><br>
You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you. - Isaiah 26:3
<br><br>
He wanted these people to search for God in hope that, by groping for Him, they might [eventually] find Him, even though He is not [really] very far from [any of] us. - Acts 17:27	
<br><br>
Seek the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually. - 1 Chronicles 16:11
<br><br>
29 But from there you will seek the Lord your God and you will find him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. - Deuteronomy 4:29
<br><br>
My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food,
<br>
    and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips,
<br>
6 when I remember you upon my bed,
<br>
    and meditate on you in the watches of the night; - Psalm 63:5-6
<br><br>
“One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much. 11 If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? - Luke 16:10-11

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
