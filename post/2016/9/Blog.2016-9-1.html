                <h3><a href="#">Change Your Mind</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on September 1st, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
We will not change something we don't believe can be changed. Suffering from depression, anxiety, and other issues is not the same as fighting them. We have let our minds run rampant, like a spoiled child being fed junk food and given no rules. The result is disaster for both parent and child. We act like we can watch anything, listen to anything, and say anything and some how our brain isn't affected. It isn't true. Good news is that means there actually are ways to make your brain healthier. There are three things you should do.
<br>
First, watch your diet(meaning media). Listen to plenty of worship/Christian music, watch Christian movies, watch/listen to sermons, read Christian books and the Bible. Keep certain bad things out. Pray and use the Holy Spirit to guide you in what media should be more limited or cut completely. 
<br>
Second, watch your tongue and ears. There are some words you have no business saying or hearing. Don't take part in, or at least limit, pointless negative conversation.  Your words shape your world and your brain. Use them wisely.
<br>
Third, be the boss. Scripture says take all thoughts captive in the name of Jesus. Pay more attention to the thoughts than run through your head. Take them captive and ask who sent you and where are you going. You'll find that some are from worldly or even demonic sources that are leading in a bad direction. 
<br>
Be intentional about keeping your focus on Christ. I believe many others, like myself, can start winning the battle against depression when we bring Him into it.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
 For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and of a sound mind. - 2 Timothy 1:7
<br><br>
Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will. - Romans 12:2
<br><br>
 We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, - 2 Corinthians 10:5
 <br><br>
 You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you. - Isaiah 26:3
  <br><br>
 Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God. - Psalm 42:5

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
