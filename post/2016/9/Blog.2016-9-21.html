There is going to be times that being on God's side feels like the losing one. Despite winning the war there are going to be battles we lose or at least feel that way. We have to know that as followers of Jesus. Satan is good at making us feel that every little scratch is some major setback. There are going to be loses that really are devastating and embarrassing. Which means there are going to be times that, like {Mal Reynolds}, you're going to need to stand firm in the face of scoffers knowing you are on the right side. 
<br><br>
Remember the disciples didn't get what Jesus's mission was before the cross. They didn't know that chapter of the story was coming. Most Jews at that time expected that the Messiah was going to come riding in as a powerful warrior, free them from Roman rule and reestablish their kingdom. Calvary felt like such a huge defeat. It must have been very devastating and confusing.
<br><br>
We are on God's side and regardless of how things feel or appear at one moment He has all eternity in his hand. Spoiler alert, we win.

				<h6>Verses</h6>
				<p>
Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen. - Revelation 1:7 
<br><br>
13 Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?” 14 I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
<br><br>
15 “Therefore they are before the throne of God,
<br>
    and serve him day and night in his temple;
<br>
    and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.
<br>
16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;
<br>
    the sun shall not strike them,
<br>
    nor any scorching heat.
<br>
17 For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,
<br>
    and he will guide them to springs of living water,
<br><br>
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.” - Revelation 7:13-17
<br><br>
And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. - Revelation 12:11
<br><br>
They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings--and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers." - Revelation 17:14
<br><br>
He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away. - Revelation 21:4 
<br><br>
12 I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. 13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me. - Philippians 4:12-13
<br><br>
12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. - Ephesians 6:12
<br><br>
13 No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it. - 1 Corinthians 10:13
<br><br>
4 For the LORD your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.” - Deuteronomy 20:4 
<br><br>
4 for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. - 1 John 5:4
<br><br>
31 What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? - Romans 8:31-32
<br><br>
But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. - 1 Corinthians 15:57

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
