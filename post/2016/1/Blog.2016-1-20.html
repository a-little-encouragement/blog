                <h3><a href="#">Scripture Prayer List pt 1</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on January 20st, 2016.</h6>
<p>
Prayer is something I've struggled with. That scene in war room when the main character first tries praying is a pretty accurate picture of me. Two things I have found that have been helpful is "prepping". I've been reading scripture (or perhaps listening to a song). The second is writing. Rather than just closing my eyes and trying to focus I get a notebook and start writing as the words flow. When the words stop I'll close my eyes and try to listen or pray the things I just can't express in words or read(re-read) more. The scriptures help me know what to pray and the pen helps keep me focused. It also helps to do this per topic/person I wish to pray for. Here is an article that list some versus to pray for our sons.

I think we can be a powerful prayer army that makes all of darkness tremble.

                <h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
Answer me when I call to you, my righteous God. Give me relief from my distress; have mercy on me and hear my prayer. - Psalm 4:1
<br><br>
The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. - Psalm 145:18
<br><br>
So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him. - Matt 7:11
<br><br>
In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. - Romans 8:26
<br><br>
Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God - Phil 4:6
<br><br>
Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. - Col 4:2
<br><br>
1 I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people— 2 for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. - 1 Tim 2:1-2
<br><br>
Psalm 116 
I love the Lord, because he has heard<br>
    my voice and my pleas for mercy.<br>
2 Because he inclined his ear to me,<br>
    therefore I will call on him as long as I live.<br>
3 The snares of death encompassed me;<br>
    the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me;<br>
    I suffered distress and anguish.<br>
4 Then I called on the name of the Lord:<br>
    “O Lord, I pray, deliver my soul!”<br>
5 Gracious is the Lord, and righteous;<br>
    our God is merciful.<br>
6 The Lord preserves the simple;<br>
    when I was brought low, he saved me.<br>
7 Return, O my soul, to your rest;<br>
    for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.<br>
8 For you have delivered my soul from death,<br>
    my eyes from tears,<br>
    my feet from stumbling;<br>
9 I will walk before the Lord<br>
    in the land of the living.<br>
10 I believed, even when I spoke:<br>
    “I am greatly afflicted”;<br>
11 I said in my alarm,<br>
    “All mankind are liars.”<br>
12 What shall I render to the Lord<br>
    for all his benefits to me?<br>
13 I will lift up the cup of salvation<br>
    and call on the name of the Lord,<br>
14 I will pay my vows to the Lord<br>
    in the presence of all his people.<br>
15 Precious in the sight of the Lord<br>
    is the death of his saints.<br>
16 O Lord, I am your servant;<br>
    I am your servant, the son of your maidservant.<br>
    You have loosed my bonds.<br>
17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving<br>
    and call on the name of the Lord.<br>
18 I will pay my vows to the Lord<br>
    in the presence of all his people,<br>
19 in the courts of the house of the Lord,<br>
    in your midst, O Jerusalem.<br>
Praise the Lord!

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
