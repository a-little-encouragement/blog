                <h3><a href="#">On The Barely Fields Of Bethlehem</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on January 20st, 2016.</h6>
<p>
So to continue my story, the match of me and this man just seemed wrong and unfair. I was a wandering widow and he was from a rich family firmly established in the community. Story sound familiar? My identity crisis brought me to the barely fields of Bethlehem. I wouldn't have expected the story of Ruth to make to feel better. But as I studied the book two things struck me. The first was the way Boaz speaks to/of Ruth. The word he uses to describe Ruth is also in Proverbs 31. He clearly didn't think he was getting a bad deal. The second thing I noticed was even though they were very different physically speaking, spiritually they were cut from the same cloth. There is a lot I could say of the book of Ruth but I won't try to in this post. God used that to help me overcome my false sense of identity. It is still a struggle sometimes, but I remind myself I'm not who I was. God has washed me and made me clean. I am a beloved daughter of the most high King. I am His and He is mine. I have another song because sometimes He just likes to dance with his girls. 
</p>	
                <h6>Verse:</h6>
				<p>
11 But Boaz answered her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told to me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before. 12 The Lord repay you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge!” - Ruth 2:11-12
<br><br>
11 And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you request, for all the people of my town know that you are a virtuous woman. - Ruth 3:11
<br><br>
Who can find a virtuous[a] wife? For her worth is far above rubies. - Proverbs 31:10
<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a . Proverbs 31:10 Literally a wife of valor, in the sense of all forms of excellence

				<h6>Song:</h6>

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
