                <h3><a href="#">Praise</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on January 30th, 2016.</h6>
<p>
Lately I've stepped up my prayer game. I increased my request but I realized my praise and gratitude should also increase. We know the importance of an attitude of gratitude. We hear it all the time. Have you ever noticed a good portion of psalms are dedicated to recalling the past work of God? The Israelites were instructed to remember what God had done. I believe it applies to us too. God knows the fickle hearts of humans and the enemy's tactics. He knew, if we didn't intentionally remind ourselves, we could fall for Satan's lies and end up in despair. Before I tried to make list of blessings and go over them but lately I've tried going into more detail. Writing out my praises and God's past victories similar to the psalms. Sometimes they are more poetic and metaphorical. Other times it is just a literal recount of a past event. Sometimes it is both (ex. "You brought me out of the desert"). What ever words come out,  the important thing is to take time to dwell on God and all he is. This has helped in my battle of depression and just makes me feel closer to Jesus. He deserve all our praise and more. Compared to Him, problems seem so small. In His light, darkness will flee and the enemy will be exposed. Let us praise the only One who shines brighter than 10,000 suns!

                <h6>Verse:</h6>
				<p>
Psalm 103<br>
Bless the Lord, O My Soul<br>
Of David.
<br><br>
103 Bless the Lord, O my soul,<br>
    and all that is within me,<br>
    bless his holy name!<br>
2 Bless the Lord, O my soul,<br>
    and forget not all his benefits,<br>
3 who forgives all your iniquity,<br>
    who heals all your diseases,<br>
4 who redeems your life from the pit,<br>
    who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,<br>
5 who satisfies you with good<br>
    so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.<br>
6 The Lord works righteousness<br>
    and justice for all who are oppressed.<br>
7 He made known his ways to Moses,<br>
    his acts to the people of Israel.<br>
8 The Lord is merciful and gracious,<br>
    slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.<br>
9 He will not always chide,<br>
    nor will he keep his anger forever.<br>
10 He does not deal with us according to our sins,<br>
    nor repay us according to our iniquities.<br>
11 For as high as the heavens are above the earth,<br>
    so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;<br>
12 as far as the east is from the west,<br>
    so far does he remove our transgressions from us.<br>
13 As a father shows compassion to his children,<br>
    so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him.<br>
14 For he knows our frame;<br>
    he remembers that we are dust.<br>
15 As for man, his days are like grass;<br>
    he flourishes like a flower of the field;<br>
16 for the wind passes over it, and it is gone,<br>
    and its place knows it no more.<br>
17 But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him,<br>
    and his righteousness to children's children,<br>
18 to those who keep his covenant<br>
    and remember to do his commandments.<br>
19 The Lord has established his throne in the heavens,<br>
    and his kingdom rules over all.<br>
20 Bless the Lord, O you his angels,<br>
    you mighty ones who do his word,<br>
    obeying the voice of his word!<br>
21 Bless the Lord, all his hosts,<br>
    his ministers, who do his will!<br>
22 Bless the Lord, all his works,<br>
    in all places of his dominion.<br>
Bless the Lord, O my soul!<br>

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
