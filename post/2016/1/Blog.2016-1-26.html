Did you not...? Are you not...? Will you not..? 
Before David fought Goliath Saul gave him his armor. But David refused it because he had not tested it. David didn't have history with armor. He wasn't use to moving in it and he wasn't going go put his faith in it. But David did have a history with God. David knew he could count on God in the fight with Goliath because he had tested God and knew he was faithful. In the same way, we can look back at our history with God and know he can be trusted and worldly things cannot. We can be bold giant slayers too. Did God not save us in the past? Is he not the same God today? Will he not save us now?
</p>	
                <h6>Verses and Quote:</h6>
				<p>
But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep his father’s sheep, and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, 35 I went out after it and struck it, and delivered the lamb from its mouth; and when it arose against me, I caught it by its beard, and struck and killed it. 36 Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.” 37 Moreover David said, “The Lord, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” 
<br>
And Saul said to David, “Go, and the Lord be with you!”
<br>
38 So Saul clothed David with his armor, and he put a bronze helmet on his head; he also clothed him with a coat of mail. 39 David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, “I cannot walk with these, for I have not tested them.” So David took them off - 1 Samuel 17:34-38
<br><br>
45 Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. 46 This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. 47 Then all this assembly shall know that the Lord does not save with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord’s, and He will give you into our hands.” - 1 Samuel 17:45-47
<br><br>
For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. - Ephesians 6:12
<br><br>
"From the tip of my toes to the top of my head
They're gonna know I love you
From the tip of my toes to the top of my head
They're gonna know I'm Yours"

"There's a line and I’ve crossed it.
Some would say that we've lost it.
Who cares what the world thinks.
I have found my joy. " - Steffany Gretzinger

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
