                <h3><a href="#">Abigail</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on January 21st, 2016.</h6>
<p>
This morning I found myself reflecting on Abigail(1 Sam 25). Abigail was the wise wife of a foolish man and saved many. Brad has talked about his wife being a velvet brick. Abigail is certainly an example of that. That is the type of woman I want to be. She bravely faced the wrath of both David and her husband Nabal to save many. She is wise enough to know when to speak and when to be silent. Her words to an angry David do three things; she apologizes for the wrong done, she points David to the future when he would regret the massacre he is planning, and she points him to God who is his defender. She gives him perspective. I pray we will be that kind of woman and that that kind of person will intersect our path if we lose are head.
</p>	
                <h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
24 She fell at his feet and said, “On me alone, my lord, be the guilt. Please let your servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your servant. 25 Let not my lord regard this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent. 26 Now then, my lord, as the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, because the Lord has restrained you from bloodguilt and from saving with your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal. 27 And now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord. 28 Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the Lord, and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live. 29 If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the Lord your God. And the lives of your enemies he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling. 30 And when the Lord has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you and has appointed you prince over Israel, 31 my lord shall have no cause of grief or pangs of conscience for having shed blood without cause or for my lord working salvation himself. And when the Lord has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.”
<br><br>
32 And David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! 33 Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt and from working salvation with my own hand! - 1 Sam 25:24-33

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
