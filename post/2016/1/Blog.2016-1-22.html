                <h3><a href="#">Integrity</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on January 22nd, 2016.</h6>
<p>
I have been praying the scriptures from that list I sent before. I have also been praying a similar list for the future Mr. Pepper (I won't really make him take my last name I guess). Wednesday's prayer was for his integrity(The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them. - Proverbs 11:3). Last night the scripture for Caleb was also about integrity.(And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my rules, then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, ‘You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’ - 1 Kings 9:4-5) I know when God gets thematic he really wants me to pay attention. So what does it even mean to have integrity? Sounds like something I want, not only for my guys, but for myself.

<br><br>

Honest and undivided. Integrity is where our action and our values overlap.<br>
C.S. Lewis summed it up when he said 'Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching.' <br>
In his book The Screwtape Letters the demon Screwtape says 
<i>"It is only in so far as they reach the will and are there embodied in habits that the virtues are really fatal to us. (I don't, of course, mean what the patient mistakes for his will,  conscious fume and fret of resolutions and clenched teeth, but the real centre, what [God] calls the Heart.) All sorts of virtues painted in the fantasy or approved by the intellect or even, in some measure, loved and admired, will not keep a man from [satan's] house: indeed they may make him more amusing when he gets there."</i> 
<br><br>
I don't want virtues to only be fantasy. I don't want my mouth the say one thing and my hand do another. I don't want to just say I love God and will follow him and he can have all of me, I want to act like it.

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
