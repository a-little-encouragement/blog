                <h3><a href="#">The Expectation Gap: Part 3</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on April 19th, 2016.</h6><a href="Blog.2016-4-13.html">Part 2 &rarr;</a>
				<p>
Life is disappointing. We often find ourselves frustrated when things don't go the way we expect. This post series are my reflections and notes on this sermon series by Steven Furtick and Jonathan Martin.
<br><br>
Sermon 3 link: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUp_sKFjTfU&list=PLFrHDxoEf4t0Bj-eqBkt45sHC8XlmF9Et&index=3&nohtml5=False" target = "_blank">Seat of Honor</a>
<br><br>
God wants us to be free from being controlled by the expectations of other people. 
<br>
Obviously there are times the problem is your performance. But,  you can be doing exactly what God would have you do and some people are going to have something to say about it. When Mary poured out a perfume that cost a years wages on Jesus you bet people had something to say. Then she even had the nerve to let down her hair. Once again people criticize Mary for her love and devotion to Jesus. Once again Jesus defends her. Her eyes weren't on Martha or Judas, they were on Jesus. We should expect to disappoint others in our attempt to follow Jesus. Let us respond like Nehemiah and say, "I'm doing a great work and can't come down" and from there let Jesus defend us and justify us. People's opinion lose their weight when we care more about Jesus'.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
so I sent messengers to them with this reply: "I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?" - Nehemiah 6:3 
<br><br>
2 Here a dinner was given in Jesus’ honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. 3 Then Mary took about a pint[a] of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus’ feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
<br><br>
4 But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, 5 “Why wasn’t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year’s wages.[b]” 6 He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.
<br><br>
7 “Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. - John 12:2-7

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
