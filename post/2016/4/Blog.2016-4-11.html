                <h3><a href="#">Slander</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on April 11th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
I should expect slander from those that aren't part of the Church but it shocks me so much of it comes from believers. Satan is called the accuser and our God is called a God of mercy. Can't help but conclude that you are resembling Satan more than you are resembling Christ when you accuse. Don't let others keep you from listening to or reading things or going places you may find helpful. 
<br><br>
Now with that said, yes there are some teachings that are wrong and harmful and things we need to speak out against or be wary of. No one wants to be lead astray, supporting bad things, or get made a fool of.  Keep these tips in mind:
<br><br>
Don't shy away from those whose opinions are different than the one you currently have. If your ideas can't stand up for themselves they deserve to fall.  
<br><br>
Listen to multiple voices. Don't just listen to one preacher or read one author. The internet makes this easy.
<br><br>
Look for and speak specifics. Generic labels and name calling is pointless and leads to harm. Respectfully point out or ask for specifically what is wrong. 
<br><br>
No one is perfect and no thing is perfect. You don't have to live a word of what you preach for God to put good words in your mouth for someone else. A church doesn't have to be perfect to do God's work. 
<br><br>
Remember other people are God's children too. Just because their walk looks different and they don't agree on every little point doesn't mean they are Godless heathens that are actually doing the devil's work. 
<br><br>
Which brings me to my last point; there are VERY few things which truly matter. It really doesn't matter if God made the world in seven days or seven billion days, the point is God made it. The details aren't important and don't be so foolish to think you are completely right. 
<br><br>
In summary, ease up and lighten up.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world. - 1 John 4:2-3
<br><br>
Straightening up, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?” 11She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said, “I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on sin no more.” -   John 8:10-11
<br><br>
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. - Ephesians 4:31-32

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
