                <h3><a href="#">The Expectation Gap: Part 2</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on April 13th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
Life is disappointing. We often find ourselves frustrated when things don't go the way we expect. This post series are my reflections and notes on this sermon series by Steven Furtick and Jonathan Martin.
<br><br>
Sermon 2 link: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv48VdJl_8I&index=2&list=PLFrHDxoEf4t0Bj-eqBkt45sHC8XlmF9Et&nohtml5=False" target = "_blank">Even Now Somehow</a>
<br><br>
Jesus disappoints me sometime. I know that sounds blasphemous. However,  I am not so in tune with God or perfect that I know His plans and never have ideas of how things should go. His ways are not my ways(and that is a really good thing for everyone). Jesus made a habit of disappointing people. The Jews expected Him to be a mighty warrior that kicked Roman butt. Instead He was hung on a cross. David was told he would be king of Israel yet he was ran out of the country and had to hide as a fugitive. Abraham was promised many descendants yet he watched his wife go through menopause without ever having a child. Joseph was given a dream of being a great leader and then was sold into slavery and imprisoned on a false charge. Martha and Mary expected Jesus to come right away and heal their sick brother,  His beloved friend. Instead He delayed and the sisters watched their brother die.  We know the ending to these stories so it is easy to forget the people didn't. It is easy to forget they had to take it a day at a time too. It is easy to forgot God is still in control and he knows what he is doing. 
<br><br>
When Jesus disappointed Martha and Mary, Martha ran out to meet him. We tend to give Martha a lot of grief but let's give her credit for not staying at the house. I believe this is a model of how we should handle our own disappointment with Jesus. She didn't wait for him to come to her. She didn't even wait for him to come into the town. We when talk to Jesus about our problems and concerns it gives him the chance to address them. One last thing I'd like to point out is Jesus cried. He already said what he was about to do but it still broke his heart to put the siblings through that. God isn't indifferent to our emotions. There is no one safer to disclose to. There is no leader more deserving of our trust.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
17 So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days. 18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away. 19 And many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
<br><br>
20 Now Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house. 21 Now Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. 22 But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.”
<br><br>
23 Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”
<br><br>
24 Martha said to Him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”
<br><br>
25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. 26 And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?”
<br><br>
27 She said to Him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.”
<br><br>
28 And when she had said these things, she went her way and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, “The Teacher has come and is calling for you.” 29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came to Him. 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met Him. 31 Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to weep there.”
<br><br>
32 Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.”
<br><br>
33 Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled. 34 And He said, “Where have you laid him?” - John 11:1 - 33

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
