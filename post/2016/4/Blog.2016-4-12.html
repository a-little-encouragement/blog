                <h3><a href="#">The Expectation Gap: Part 1</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on April 12th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
Life is disappointing. We often find ourselves frustrated when things don't go the way we expect. This post series are my reflections and notes on this sermon series by Steven Furtick and Jonathan Martin.
<br><br>
Sermon 1 link: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLQ2NfRzZz4&list=PLFrHDxoEf4t0Bj-eqBkt45sHC8XlmF9Et" target = "_blank">The Greatest Source of My Frustration</a>
<br><br>
Mary, Martha, and Lazarus have a lot to teach us about disappointment. In Luke chapter 10 we meet the two sisters. Martha has opened up her home and is serving Jesus and his companions. Martha is frustrated because her sister is not helping with the work like she expects. Her expectation was difference than her experience. 
<br>
Let us note several things:
<br>
First express what is on you mind. At least Martha said what was bothering her. I know I have been guilty of not expression my frustrations and others have neglected to tell me. I feel we women are especially bad at this cause we fall for the myth that if someone cares about us they should just know. They don't. If you want something you might have to actually ask.
<br>
Second you can't control others people relationship with God. Don't project your gifts, callings, and strengths on to other people.
<br>
Don't drag others into your dysfunction. Martha was so concerned we Mary she was blind to her own problems. She was busy worrying about food for the man that feed thousands with few loaves and fish. 
<br>
Don't be confused about God's exceptions of you. If you think God expects you to make a full course meal that is going to be your main concern. If you realize God desires for you to listen to him when he speaks your actions are going to be different. How you treat others is going to be different. 
<br>
Lastly, don't let what you expected keep you from what God wants you to experience.

				<h6>Verse:</h6>
				<p>
At the Home of Martha and Mary
<br>
38 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. 39 She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. 40 But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”
<br>
41 “Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about many things, 42 but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.” - Luke 10:38-42

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
