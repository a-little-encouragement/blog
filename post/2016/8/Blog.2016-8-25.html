                <h3><a href="#">Trust The Deck</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on August 25th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
Awhile back I prayed the prayer of "anything". "Anything Lord", I declared, "You can have anything". God has held me to that. Lately there has been a lot of changes that have really pushed my trust and instructions that have tested my obedience. Like most Christians I've sung "Oceans" but life has been forcing my hand. Was I bluffing or did I mean those words I sang and prayed? During this struggle God showed me a deck of cards. I had some cards in my hand. I could either play with what I had or I could give cards back for a chance at something better. I could keep my cards but every card I didn't lay down was a card God couldn't do something with. It was a spot taken up in my hand blocking a new card that might be even better. Though part of me really didn't want to, I gave Him all my cards. Some of the cards He handed right back to me. Then He drew from the deck and handed me a new one. It was awful. I didn't want that card at all. But then He drew one more card and it was a great one, better than any I ever had in my hand before. God told me I have to be willing to trust Him for Him to work. He knows what the future holds and I do not. He knows better than I do what I will need and when. He isn't playing guessing games and distraught when a crisis arises. He is loving and wants what is best for me, and those around me. I know that to be true, but do I show it in my attitude and actions?

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
 But Samuel replied: "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams. - 1 Samuel 15:22 
<br><br>
Jesus Calms the Storm<br>
35 That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side.” 36 Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. 37 A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. 38 Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?”
<br>
39 He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.
<br>
40 He said to his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?”
<br>
41 They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!” - Mark 4:35-41
<br><br>
29 “Come,” he said.
<br>
Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. 30 But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”
<br>
31 Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?”  - Matthew 14:29-31
<br><br>
12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 13 I can do all this through him who gives me strength. - Philippians 4:12-13
<br><br>
8 “For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
    neither are your ways my ways,”
declares the Lord.
9 “As the heavens are higher than the earth,
    so are my ways higher than your ways
    and my thoughts than your thoughts. - Isaiah 55:8-9
<br><br>
27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?
<br>
28 “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. - Matthew 6:27-29
<br><br>
28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. - Romans 8:28
<br><br>
“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” – Jeremiah 29:11
<br><br>
10 “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. 11 So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? - Luke 16:10-11

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
