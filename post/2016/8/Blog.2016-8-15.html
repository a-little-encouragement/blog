                <h3><a href="#">The Gospel Truth : Part 1</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on August 15th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
The truth of the gospel, the truth of God's forgiveness and mercy, is one of the simplest things in the world and yet the hardest truth to fully comprehend. It runs counter to our nature. It is NOT about performance. Your past is not only forgiven it is embraced. God is not like a person begrudgingly forgiving once, and then surprised, livid, and unforgiving when He must do it again for the same thing. I've said before, you can never take God by surprise. He never needs a cool off period. He chose to embrace us, faults and all. The enemy is actively trying to block this truth. He is trying to make us feel that somehow Jesus loves us more or less based on the day. That isn't God. It is us whose emotions are so fickle. Our salvation is not dependent on us, thank God. It is secure. Shame and fear are never from God so never let it keep you from His throne room. Jesus already bought you an all access pass. God never desires us to punish ourselves by not using it.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
14 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.”
<br>
16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. - John 3:14-16
<br><br>
Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, 2 because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death. - Romans 8:1-2 
<br><br>
"Come now, let us settle the matter," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. - Isaiah 1:18
<br><br>
When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. - John 19:30 
<br><br>
10 Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? 11 No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.” - Acts 15:10-11
<br><br>
6 Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness. - Genesis 15:6

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
