                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on August 17th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
				I wrote in my last post about the radical grace God offers. We need to remember that grace is for other people too. I think, sometimes, we don't extend that grace to others because we haven't comprehended it ourselves. If we still view our relationship with God as performance based, we treat others by a performance-based system. We need to stop fretting so much over others sins. No one is sinless except Jesus so we need to stop making our main goal behavior correction. I have hesitated writing this because it may seem more like a rebuke than "a little encouragement". But, it is encouraging because it is actually freeing. There is freedom in forgiveness. There is freedom in realizing that the people you love don't need to be up to a certain standard for salvation. There is freedom in realizing God says not only is it okay to love the sinner, you are commanded to. Hate the sin, love the sinner doesn't mean only love the sinner once he has stopped sinning. There is freedom in being secure in your own salvation. Jesus changed the equation of the old testament which said if something pure touches something unclean it becomes unclean. Whoever touches Jesus becomes clean. Our job as Christians is not to correct behavior. It is to love others as Christ loves them, just where and how they are. We are to take His light and spread it. 
<br>
There is also freedom in removing the plank out of your own eye. Just because some sins are more socially acceptable doesn't mean God views them as more or less. A man who identifies himself as homosexual and doesn't know the Lord is no further or closer than a straight-identified man who doesn't know the Lord. Focus more on praying for God to search your heart and show you any ways in you that you need to fix than telling him how you think He needs to change others. God has loved you with an everlasting love and granted you unfailing and unlimited mercy. Go and do likewise.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
 "I will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them.- Hosea 14:4
<br><br>
10 Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? 11 No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.” - Acts 15:10-11
<br><br>
16 When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
<br>
17 On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” - Mark 2:16-17
<br><br>
15 For he says to Moses,

“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,

    and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” 
<br>
16 It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.

So then, it does not depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.  - Romans 9:15-16
<br><br>
6 Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness. - Genesis 15:6
<br><br>
The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant(Matthew 18:21-35)
<br><br>
21 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”
<br>


22 Jesus answered, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.[a]
<br>


23 “Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. 24 As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold[b] was brought to him. 25 Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.

<br>

26 “At this the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’ 27 The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.
<br>


28 “But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins.[c] He grabbed him and began to choke him. ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ he demanded.

<br>

29 “His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.’


<br>
30 “But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. 31 When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.


<br>
32 “Then the master called the servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said, ‘I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. 33 Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?’ 34 In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.


<br>
35 “This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
