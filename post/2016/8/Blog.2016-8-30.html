                <h3><a href="#">As Yourself</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on August 30th, 2016.</h6>

Scripture says love your neighbor as yourself. I think for many people that is exactly the problem. If you are filled with self-loathing how does that equation work out? 
1 John says God is love. Not "God does love". Love is not something God feels or does, it is His very substance. Father, Son, Holy Spirit all together as one through love. That's right, God loves himself. Jesus said He loves the Father and the Father loves and delights in Him. We are created in His image. We are created by love, through love, in love. You are free to love yourself. God didn't work hard on you for you to tell Him his work is crap. It is not conceited. That is a lie from Satan. Real humility is accepting truth, not self-hatred. I don't believe we are capable of truly loving others if we don't love ourselves. I don't believe we are capable of viewing others as Christ does if we can't do it for us. I don't believe we can love ourselves if we do not comprehend God's love for us. In the story of the prodigal son, the son came home asking to just be a slave in his father's house. His father however immediately restored full family status back. Some of us have come home and are acting like a servant rather than a son or daughter. To God you are a special treasure, a labor of love, a masterpiece of art, and He loves you dearly. Try doing the same.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
 29 “The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’[b] 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.” - Mark 12:29-31

7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. - 1 John 4:7-8

 “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love." - John 15:9

The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. - John 3:35

I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.” - John 17:26

but so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do exactly as the Father commanded Me Get up, let us go from here. - John 14:31

So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. - Genesis 1:27

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
