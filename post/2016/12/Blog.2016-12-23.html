				<p>
I've been convinced of God's ability to do anything for a long time. His willingness to is another story. It is still sometimes hard to believe that the God who create the whole universe cares about my personal happiness. Since we are broken people, living in a broken world, it is easy to forget that God is a loving father that wants to pour out extravagant gifts on us. Those gifts don't always look like what we think they should. Those gifts don't always look like bags of gold, a perfect house, and perfect relationships. Sometimes they look like a baby lying in a manger. Sometimes they look like a man on a cross. Sometimes they look like "no" because God knows things we don't. God isn't after His personal interested in spite of ours. If that was true He wouldn't have made us in the first place(He knew what we would do). Eve ate the fruit because she believed the lie that God didn't have her best interest in mind. The truth is so easy to know with our mind, and so hard to believe with our hearts. If we, being imperfect, care about our children's well-being and are pained when they experience pain, how much more does God care about our well-being and how much more does He hurt at our suffering?  This is the truth, I do not serve an apathetic God.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
	10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? 11 If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! - Matthew 7:10-11
<br><br>
4 Take delight in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart. 5 Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this: 6 He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn, your vindication like the noonday sun. 7 Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when people succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes. 8 Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret—it leads only to evil. 9 For those who are evil will be destroyed, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land. 10 A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found. 11 But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy peace and prosperity. 12 The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them; 13 but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming. 14 The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright. - Psalm 37:4-14 
<br><br>
33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. 34 “Where have you laid him?” he asked.
<br>
“Come and see, Lord,” they replied.
<br>
35 Jesus wept.
<br>
36 Then the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” - John 11:33-36
<br><br>
18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. 19 We love because he first loved us. - 1 John 4:18-19 
<br><br>
16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. - John 3:16

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
