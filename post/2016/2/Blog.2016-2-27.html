                <h3><a href="#">The Right Job</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on February 27th, 2016.</h6>
<p>
While in school great companies had shown interest in me. However when it came time to get an internship, one after another, all these places fell through. One company in particular I thought was the dream job. I would be doing important work that was really helping people and the environment seemed great. I was already pushing the internship deadline when I called this company and found out I had been rejected for the job. I ended up in a last resort internship that hardly had anything to do with my actually career field. Not all of it was bad, and I'm grateful to the company for taking me in, there was just no future there. I felt rejected. I did well in school. Why am I here in a basement rather than in a shiny lab? Then, while still doing my internship, I went to a job interview. They needed someone right about the time my internship would be done. Perfect! I got the job and I didn't realize how perfect it was until I started. My boss is fantastic and flexible. As a single mom that is invaluable. All of my coworkers are amazing and I enjoy there company. It was the kindness of one coworker that led to this blog becoming reality. It really is the perfect job. Had I gotten what I thought I wanted in the past I would have missed it. That is just one thread I see. I also needed to be humbled by that internship and learn certain lessons. I cannot begin to see all of the many ways in which God really did work things for the best and He continues to.

				<p>
But those who wait on the Lord<br>
Shall renew their strength;<br>
They shall mount up with wings like eagles,<br>
They shall run and not be weary,<br>
They shall walk and not faint. - Isaiah 40:31<br>
<br>
He says, "Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth." - Psalm 46:10

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
