                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on February 19th, 2016.</h6>
                <p>
I know Paul said there are benefits to being single but, as a single mom, I wasn't feeling it. I had the head knowledge that God's ways are best but not the heart knowledge. Deep down part of me was still thinking I can do so much more if I had a husband. I viewed this season as something to endure. Then someone challenged that view. Singleness is a gift. Every season is.  How much better life is when we remember that. Now that I'm further along this season I can look back and see ways in which God really did know best. It has brought me closer to God and that is priceless.
                </p>               	
                <h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; 33 but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife, 34 and his interests are divided. The woman who is unmarried, and the virgin, is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 35 This I say for your own benefit; not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord. - 1 Cor 32-35
<br><br>
And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. - Romans 8:28

<br><br>
Everything has its own time, and there is a specific time for every activity under heaven:
<br>
2 a time to be born and
<br>
a time to die,
<br>
a time to plant and
<br>
a time to pull out what was planted,
<br>
3 a time to kill and
<br>
a time to heal,
<br>
a time to tear down and
<br>
a time to build up,
<br>
4 a time to cry and
<br>
a time to laugh,
<br>
a time to mourn and
<br>
a time to dance,
<br>
5 a time to scatter stones and
<br>
a time to gather them,[a]
<br>
a time to hug and
<br>
a time to stop hugging,
<br>
6 a time to start looking and
<br>
a time to stop looking,
<br>
a time to keep and
<br>
a time to throw away,
<br>
7 a time to tear apart and
<br>
a time to sew together,
<br>
a time to keep quiet and
<br>
a time to speak out,
<br>
8 a time to love and
<br>
a time to hate,
<br>
a time for war and
<br>
a time for peace.
<br>
9 What do working people gain from their hard labor? 10 I have seen mortals weighed down with a burden that God has placed on them. 11 It is beautiful how God has done everything at the right time. He has put a sense of eternity in people’s minds. Yet, mortals still can’t grasp what God is doing from the beginning to the end of time.
<br>
12 I realize that there’s nothing better for them to do than to be cheerful and enjoy what is good in their lives. 13 It is a gift from God to be able to eat and drink and experience the good that comes from every kind of hard work.
<br>
14 I realize that whatever God does will last forever. Nothing can be added to it, and nothing can be taken away from it. God does this so that people will fear him. - Ecclesiastes 3:1-14

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
