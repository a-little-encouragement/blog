                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on February 25th, 2016.</h6>

"Did you hear that? That is the sound I've been trying to get you to hear for a long time.<br>
The sound of your own voice"
</blockquote>
"You never sing anymore," He complained. <br>
"Yes I do," I replied, "I sing at the church all the time."<br>
"Only when you know no one can hear, not even you" <br>
Ouch. God does tend to be right. I'll sing along at the Church services but not loud enough to even hear myself over the music. I'd like to say that was the first time he brought it up and the last time he needed to but it was a process. To be honest it made me a little angry and sad that God kept bringing it up because I love music so much and have longed to be musically gifted. I approached this problem with more of a "How do I get God of my back" mentality than what would make him happy. I even tried singing out loud to the radio but it still wasn't right. I could tell it wasn't what God meant and what he was looking for. It was about worship. Real worship. 
<br>
"Sing your own song."<br>
But what song? I'm don't play a instrument and I don't write songs. <br>
Then one day it was just me and the Lord in my car. I was singing along to the radio. <br>
"Turn it off" he asked so, I did but, I kept singing. After I finished that song, not to impress anyone, or to get God off my back, but, just from an outpouring of love, I began to sing a new song; my own song. No I didn't compose Beethoven's 5th but I felt the Lord's delight. I got a taste of what real worship was. It is not some great musical ability. It is just pouring out our love on the feet of Jesus.

                <h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; Many will see and fear And will trust in the LORD. - Psalm 40:3
<br><br>
Sing to the LORD a new song, Sing His praise from the end of the earth! You who go down to the sea, and all that is in it You islands, and those who dwell on them. - Isaiah 42:10
<br><br>
"I tell you," he replied, "if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out." - Luke 19:40

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
