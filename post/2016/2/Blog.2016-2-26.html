                <h3><a href="#">But What If...?</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on February 26th, 2016.</h6>
<p>
<blockquote>
'I want to do God's will but I don't know what His will is? What if I get it wrong?'
</blockquote>
This fear use to paralyze me. 
<br>
"You can't go against His will if you don't know what it is"
<br>
My dad told me that then I read Luke 11. 
<br>
I can write this blog and I can prophecy and speak in tongues, not because I have some great ability myself. I don't trust me. But I trust my Father will not give me a snake when I ask him for fish. Just like writing this blog, I have to start the car and trust God will lead it. I have to let go of the fear of how I'll look or sound. I have to let go of the fear "what if I get it wrong". God can and will correct course if needed if my eyes are on him.
<br>
Let the pressure fall away and trust our good Father.
</p>	
                <h6>Verse:</h6>
				<p>
5 Jesus said to his disciples, “Suppose one of you has a friend. Suppose you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, let me borrow three loaves of bread. 6 A friend of mine on a trip has dropped in on me, and I don’t have anything to serve him.’ 7 Your friend might answer you from inside his house, ‘Don’t bother me! The door is already locked, and my children are in bed. I can’t get up to give you anything.’ 8 I can guarantee that although he doesn’t want to get up to give you anything, he will get up and give you whatever you need because he is your friend and because you were so bold.
<br><br>
9 “So I tell you to ask, and you will receive. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened for you. 10 Everyone who asks will receive. The one who searches will find, and for the person who knocks, the door will be opened.
<br><br>
11 “If your child asks you, his father, for a fish, would you give him a snake instead? 12 Or if your child asks you for an egg, would you give him a scorpion? 13 Even though you’re evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. So how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?” - Luke 11:5 - 13

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
