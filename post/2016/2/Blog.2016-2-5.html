These were the words spoken to me  after a night I messed up. I did something I knew I shouldn't have done and I was beating myself up. It still didn't really sink in though.

 Then He spoke again:
"I expect you to eat the napkins and chew up the water bottles"
That sounds really strange but God knows me. You see, I have a friend who has a giant(95lbs) three year old golden retriever poodle mix named Silas. Two of Silas's favorite things are napkins and water bottles. Despite Silas's bad habits I love him. I'm happy to see his big puppy face when ever I go over. I do not expect him to be something other than what he is. I expect him to eat my napkin and run off with my water bottle. Just like how I know dogs, and that particular dog, God knows people and He knows me. He did make me after all. I never take him by surprise.

                <h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
				Psalm 103
				<br>
Bless the Lord, O my soul,<br>
    and all that is within me,<br>
    bless his holy name!<br>
2 Bless the Lord, O my soul,<br>
    and forget not all his benefits,<br>
3 who forgives all your iniquity,<br>
    who heals all your diseases,<br>
4 who redeems your life from the pit,<br>
    who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,<br>
5 who satisfies you with good<br>
    so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.<br>
6 The Lord works righteousness<br>
    and justice for all who are oppressed.<br>
7 He made known his ways to Moses,<br>
    his acts to the people of Israel.<br>
8 The Lord is merciful and gracious,<br>
    slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.<br>
9 He will not always chide,<br>
    nor will he keep his anger forever.<br>
10 He does not deal with us according to our sins,<br>
    nor repay us according to our iniquities.<br>
11 For as high as the heavens are above the earth,<br>
    so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;<br>
12 as far as the east is from the west,<br>
    so far does he remove our transgressions from us.<br>
13 As a father shows compassion to his children,<br>
    so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him.<br>
14 For he knows our frame;<br>
    he remembers that we are dust.<br>
15 As for man, his days are like grass;<br>
    he flourishes like a flower of the field;<br>
16 for the wind passes over it, and it is gone,<br>
    and its place knows it no more.<br>
17 But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him,<br>
    and his righteousness to children's children,<br>
18 to those who keep his covenant<br>
    and remember to do his commandments.<br>
19 The Lord has established his throne in the heavens,<br>
    and his kingdom rules over all.<br>
20 Bless the Lord, O you his angels,<br>
    you mighty ones who do his word,<br>
    obeying the voice of his word!<br>
21 Bless the Lord, all his hosts,<br>
    his ministers, who do his will!<br>
22 Bless the Lord, all his works,<br>
    in all places of his dominion.<br>
Bless the Lord, O my soul!
<br><br>
Psalm 139
<br>
O Lord, you have searched me and known me!<br>
2 You know when I sit down and when I rise up;<br>
    you discern my thoughts from afar.<br>
3 You search out my path and my lying down<br>
    and are acquainted with all my ways.<br>
4 Even before a word is on my tongue,<br>
    behold, O Lord, you know it altogether.<br>
5 You hem me in, behind and before,<br>
    and lay your hand upon me.<br>
6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;<br>
    it is high; I cannot attain it.<br>
7 Where shall I go from your Spirit?<br>
    Or where shall I flee from your presence?<br>
8 If I ascend to heaven, you are there!<br>
    If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there!<br>
9 If I take the wings of the morning<br>
    and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,<br>
10 even there your hand shall lead me,<br>
    and your right hand shall hold me.<br>
11 If I say, “Surely the darkness shall cover me,<br>
    and the light about me be night,”<br>
12 even the darkness is not dark to you;<br>
    the night is bright as the day,<br>
    for darkness is as light with you.<br>
13 For you formed my inward parts;<br>
    you knitted me together in my mother's womb.<br>
14 I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.<br>
Wonderful are your works;<br>
    my soul knows it very well.<br>
15 My frame was not hidden from you,<br>
when I was being made in secret,<br>
    intricately woven in the depths of the earth.<br>
16 Your eyes saw my unformed substance;<br>
in your book were written, every one of them,<br>
    the days that were formed for me,<br>
    when as yet there was none of them.<br>
17 How precious to me are your thoughts, O God!<br>
    How vast is the sum of them!<br>
18 If I would count them, they are more than the sand.<br>
    I awake, and I am still with you.<br>
19 Oh that you would slay the wicked, O God!<br>
    O men of blood, depart from me!<br>
20 They speak against you with malicious intent;<br>
    your enemies take your name in vain.<br>
21 Do I not hate those who hate you, O Lord?<br>
    And do I not loathe those who rise up against you?<br>
22 I hate them with complete hatred;<br>
    I count them my enemies.<br>
23 Search me, O God, and know my heart!<br>
    Try me and know my thoughts!<br>
24 And see if there be any grievous way in me,<br>
    and lead me in the way everlasting!<br>

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
