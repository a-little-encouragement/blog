                <h3><a href="#">No Man Is An Island</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on February 8th, 2016.</h6>
                <p>
I'm good at book learning but relationships do not come easy. That has always been true and has carried over in my new life with Christ. Awhile back God told me a parable to help me understand the season of my life at that moment and the one to come. Although many things in my journal get written down in incoherent chicken scratch, I felt the need to write this parable out clearly. I didn't understand why at the time. Not too long later I was at the 1829 retreat. A young man said something God had told him and I instantly connected it with my parable. I knew he needed. I showed him the page in my journal and he said it really was what he needed to hear. Since then we give reports to each other of what God is doing in our lives. Last Thursday I went to an 1829 meeting and almost wanted to leave early. I felt depressed and angry and distracted. I stayed. After I went up to my brother in Christ and told him how I was feeling and the spiritual attacks I've been enduring. He didn't tell me anything I didn't know. But to hear it out loud and affirm it out loud won a victory. I got an image of the body Christ desires. Our church family is a powerful and necessary asset. Alone we are easy pray but the enemy has trouble taking us out in groups. May I be brave enough to encourage and be brave enough to seek encouragement.

                <h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: 10 If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.
Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 
<br><br>
A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity. 
Proverbs 17:17
<br><br>
As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.
Proverbs 27:17

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
