                <h3><a href="#">The Tree</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on May 23rd, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
A girl found a patch of desert land where a seed had been planted. Her Master instructed her to take care of it so she did. She watered the seed and took care of the ground. Every one around mocked her. They didn't believe anything could grow in that spot. Despite their taunts she stayed. Despite the harsh heat and storms she stayed. She had been promised something would grow. Year after year nothing grew. Then in the sixth year a small sprout broke through the earth. Very quickly this sprout became a mighty tree. The girl sat under its shade and enjoyed the wonderful fruit it produced. The people who had mocked her came and wanted some of the fruit too. They asked for some and the girl replied,  "As it was done unto me, so I'll do to you." Then she gave them plenty of fruit and let them sit in the shade. They didn't understand these things for they didn't know she was talking about her Master. The tree continued to grow under her care. Other people joined in the work. The tree continued to thrive for a long time; long after the girl was gone.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
41 “A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. 42 When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?” 43 Simon answered, “The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt.” And he said to him, “You have judged rightly.” 44 Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 45 You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. 46 You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. 47 Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.” - Luke 7:41-47
<br><br>
but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. - Philippians 3:12
<br><br>
And I am certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns. - Philippians 1:6
<br><br>
We love Him because He loved us first. - 1 John 4:19
<br><br>
For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. - Romans 11:29 
<br><br>
And those He predestined He also called, those He called He also justified, those He justified He also glorified. - Romans 8:30
<br><br>
To this end, we always pray for you, that our God will count you worthy of His calling, and that He will powerfully fulfill your every good desire and work of faith, - 2 Thessalonians 1:11
<br><br>
He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not because of our own works, but by His own purpose and by the grace He granted us in Christ Jesus before time eternal. - 2 Timothy 1:9

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
