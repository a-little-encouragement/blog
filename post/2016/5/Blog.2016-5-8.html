                <h3><a href="#">Mothers' Day</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on May 8th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
Happy mothers' day! It is a hard job that, like many moms, I often don't feel very good at. Here is an encouraging video for all the others feeling the same way. I also wrote down my reflections on being a single mother.
<br><Br>
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CjxaLixqDs" target = "_blank">A New Perspective for Moms</a>
<br><br>
Being a single mom is a hard road to walk. It is made harder by the fact most people do not plan on walking it and usually find it through traumatic circumstances. However, like many dark circumstances, it can serve as a back drop to show off the brightest of God's love and depths of His grace. I've been a single mom for over five years now. Not once has he ever dropped me. The journey,  though hard has brought me closer. Not having something else, or someone else to cling to has caused me to grip very tightly to Jesus 's hand. Through my journey I've learned He is a wonderful artist that waste nothing. Whether it be the offenses of others, seemingly random tragedy, or my own mistakes God has used it for good and His glory. That is the God I serve who calls me his own; the maker of beauty from ashes.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
3 See, children are a gift from the Lord. The children born to us are our special reward. 4 The children of a young man are like arrows in the hand of a soldier. 5 Happy is the man who has many of them. They will not be put to shame when they speak in the gate with those who hate them. - Psalm 127:3-5
<br><br>
Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it. - Proverbs 22:6
<br><br>
Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them. - Deuteronomy 4:9
<br><br>
8 Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction and do not forsake your mother’s teaching. 9 They are a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck. - Proverbs 1:8-9
<br><br>
And I will betroth you to me forever. I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy. - Hosea 2:19
<br><br>
For your Maker is your husband-- the LORD Almighty is his name-- the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; he is called the God of all the earth. - Isaiah 54:5

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
