                <h3><a href="#">Healing Testimony</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on May 26th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
We don't always see the fruit of our prayers right away. Here is one example. When I was a very young child I was diagnosed with a genetic defect that could cause me all sorts of problems. I was given a uncertain future; heart problems, kidney problems, learning problems. One thing they thought was certain was I would never have children. I didn't grow up in church,  but I do remember someone taking me not long after my diagnosis. I don't remember anything about the service except the end. To my horror when they gave the call for prayer I was picked up and taken to the alter. Some strangers prayed for me and I don't think they ever saw me again. There was no big magically moment where God confirmed He answered their prayer. But, each year, I developed fine. I even had a son. Regardless of whether our prayers get answered in the way we would like, they are very important and never ignored by God.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. - Psalm 145:18
<br><br>
Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. - James 5:14
<br><br>
This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. - 1 John 5:14
<br><br>
So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. - Isaiah 41:10
<br><br>
Hear the supplications of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive. - 2 Chronicles 6:21
<br><br>
19 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress. 20 He sent out his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave. 21 Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind. - Psalm 107:19-21
<br><br>
LORD my God, I called to you for help, and you healed me. - Psalm 30:2
<br><br>
if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land. - 2 Chronicles 7:14
<br><br>
4 Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted. 5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. - Isaiah 53:4-5
<br><br>
2 Praise the LORD, my soul, and forget not all his benefits— 3 who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, 4 who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, - Psalm 103:2-4
<br><br>
And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. - Ephesians 6:18
<br><br>
5 When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. 6 “Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.” 7 Jesus said to him, “Shall I come and heal him?” 8 The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. 9 For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” 10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. - Matthew 8:5-10

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
