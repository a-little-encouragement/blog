                <h3><a href="#">Is He Safe?</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on May 12th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
"The safest place to be is in God's will." What if I told you that wasn't true. Or, at least, it's a bit misleading. Stephen (verse) would argue with that statement. He was stoned to death for declaring the gospel. Job might argue with you too. I
love the Chronicles of Narnia and I love Aslan(who represents Jesus). A giant lion paints an accurate picture. Gentle and kind, but wild and powerful, and oh so very beautiful. 				
<blockquote>
“Safe?” said Mr. Beaver; “don’t you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you? Who said anything about safe? ‘Course he isn’t safe. But he’s good. He’s the King, I tell you.” 
― C.S. Lewis, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe
</blockquote>
God is good and He is very much in love with us. He can be trusted. But his ways are not our ways. Sometimes that good and that best does not mean earthly

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. - 1 Peter 4:12
<br><br>
10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. - 1 Peter 5:10
<br><br>
and you will be hated by all for my name’s sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. - Matthew 10:22
<br><br>
For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. - Deuteronomy 4:24
<br><br>
54 The Jews and religious leaders listened to Stephen. Then they became angry and began to grind their teeth at him. 55 He was filled with the Holy Spirit. As he looked up to heaven, he saw the shining-greatness of God and Jesus standing at the right side of God. 56 He said, “See! I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right side of God!” 57 They cried out with loud voices. They put their hands over their ears and they all pushed on him. 58 Then they took him out of the city and threw stones at him. The men who were throwing the stones laid their coats down in front of a young man named Saul. 59 While they threw stones at Stephen, he prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” 60 After that he fell on his knees and cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” When he had said this, he died.- Acts 7:54-60				</p>

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
