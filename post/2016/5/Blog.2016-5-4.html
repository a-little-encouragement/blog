                <h3><a href="#">Crucibles and Security Blankets</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on May 4th, 2016.</h6>
				<p>
<blockquote>
				"Sooner or later, we all go through a crucible...Most believe there are two types of people who go into a crucible. The ones who become stronger from the experience and survive it, and the ones who die. But there's a third type. The ones who learn to love the fire and choose to stay in their crucible because it's easier to embrace the pain when it's all you know anymore." 
				<br>
				- Sebastian Blood : <i>Arrow season 2 episode 4 "Crucible"</i>
</blockquote>
				<br><br>
I'll confess I've been the third type. Pain and depression are probably the most familiar things to me. This is quickly becoming untrue. But I still struggle with the tendency to grab onto it like Linus with his blanket. It clouds my eyes. It blinds me to God's presence and makes Him feel far away. Even Linus dropped his blanket when focused on Jesus. I want to trade in my blanket for the joy of the Lord. Angela Thomas talked about this principle in her study Stronger. She compared it to the author of Psalm 84 traveling through the Valley of Baca(weeping). They had to go through it, not make their home there. While there, when they get thirsty, they dig. We too should dig for the living water that Jesus promises. Press in. Spend more time in prayer, spend more time worshiping, spend more time in the Word, but don't stop digging. Jesus promises to draw near to us if we draw near to him.

				<h6>Verses:</h6>
				<p>
5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in You,
<br>
Whose heart is set on pilgrimage.
<br>
6 As they pass through the Valley of Baca,
<br>
They make it a spring;
<br>
The rain also covers it with pools.
<br>
7 They go from strength to strength;
<br>
Each one appears before God in Zion. - Psalm 84:5-7
<br><br>
12 Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 13 Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, - Philippians 3:12-13
<br><br>
6 In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. 7 These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. 8 Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy,
<br><br>
Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.'"… -  John 7:37-38
<br><br>
Nehemiah said, “Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.” - Nehemiah 8:10
<br><br>
10 Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.”
<br>
11 “Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? 12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?”
<br>
13 Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, 14 but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” - John 4:10-14
<br><br>
12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 13 I can do all this through him who gives me strength. - Philippians 4:12-13

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
