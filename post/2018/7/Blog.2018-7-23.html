Psalm 139 is one of my favorite psalms. Particularly I like verse thirteen. I like this verse because a lot of translations use the word "knit." Since I am a knitter this speaks differently to me than the word "made". I have made many things. I have made a lot of sandwiches. But it is not the same as the things I knit. 
<br><br>
The Bible says God created us in His image. I believe at least part of that image is creativity. No other animal creates like we do. Even birds' and beavers' nest and dam don't compare to our long-lasting ever-changing constructions. 
<br>
Just like sandwiches don't compare to a hand knit toy. 
<br>
This series is about things God has taught me through my creativity and through knitting.

I had the opportunity to see the play Wicked back in October. I decided to knit a flying monkey doll and take it with me. While looking at the doll God asked me a question.
<br>
"Why did you make him?"
<br>
"Because I went to see a play and wanted to take him with me," I answered.
<br>
"No," He replied, "You wanted to make him even before."
<br>
He was right. I thought of making the doll before. The play was just an excuse to put it at the top of my project queue.
<br>
"And," He continued, "It doesn't explain why he is still here. The play is over."
<br>
He had me there.
<br>
"So why did you make him?"
<br>
I looked at the monkey's face. Joy and delight filled my heart. 
<br>
That was it. Delight. I made him because it delighted me. He delights me. 
<br><br>
I realized it is the same with God. God may have certain purposes in mind for us in this world. But God has no needs and our time on earth is short. The play is over and then what? We go back to His house. God created us because it delighted Him. He looks on His creation and smiles.

				<h6>Scripture:</h6>
				<p>
In My Fatherâ€™s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and welcome you into My presence, so that you also may be where I am.- John 14:2-3
<br><br>
So God created man in his own image,<br>
    in the image of God he created him;<br>
    male and female he created them. - Genesis 1:27

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
