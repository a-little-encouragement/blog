                <h3><a href="#">A Thankful Heart?</a></h3>
                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Dallas Pepper</a> on February 19th, 2018.</h6>
				<p>       	
One day I was trying to fight off a fit of depression by reminding myself of all I had to be thankful to God for. It wasn't working. For everything I could think of there was a grumbling come back. The longer this carried on the worst my feelings became. Finally God spoke. "Just worship Me for who I am". 
My initial reaction was embarrassment. I had been so focused on the work and my life, I wasn't really focusing on God at all. <br><br>
Suddenly I saw a vision of me standing in front of an almost human shaped creature. This monster was lying on the ground. I was standing. It's slow deep rattling breath contrasted with my high fast breathing. My right hand was clutched around a whip. I had been using it on the creature but it was not bowed in defeat. There was something that could, maybe, be described as a grin on, what I suppose could be called, its face. There was a mountain behind me and God was standing a few steps up. "Come" He said, extending His hand. I left the thing on the ground and went up with him. I can't say I immediately felt better or even felt thankful, but up on the mountain, surrounded by cries of "Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty" it didn't matter. 
<br><br>

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
