Last post I mentioned watching your media diet. This is something I'm passionate about because it has made such a difference in my life. We need to accept we are all influenced by our surroundings and especially the media we partake in. No one is an exception.

                <p>This started as a series of emails to a small group of my sweet sisters and quickly grew. I heard a pastor once say that he was preaching to himself. We were just listening in to what God had been working personally in him. That is what this blog is. It is a window into what God has been working in me. I pray this will help encourage other believers as they run their own race. </p>
